# "MICHAL'S TRAVELS AND TOURS"

This project is about a simple travel and tours website."MICHAL'S TRAVELS AND TOURS" where several tourists destinations are displayed.

Tourists all over book their liked destinations when they are available and choose a mode of payment.

However when the timeline is due, bookings can't be done anymore.

A timer cou nts down the days hours minutes and seconds remaining for the destination bookings expire.

All bookings are done online.
The displayed destinations are available once a tourist has keyed in their details.
## API Reference

I created and used my own db.json file .

I have two APIs embedded into one db.json file:

I fetched my destinations information using
